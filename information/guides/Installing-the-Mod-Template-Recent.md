# How to Install the Mod Template

This guide will show you how to install the mod template on a fresh copy of DDLC on Ren'Py 7.
> If you want to install the mod template on Ren'Py 6, see [How to Install the Mod Template (Legacy)](Installing-the-Mod-Template-Legacy.md)

## Requirements
1. A fresh copy of DDLC from [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe).
2. A copy of the DDLC Mod Template from [my repository](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/DDLCModTemplate2.0/releases).
   > This guide will work with the Monika After Story/RationalPi template but it is recommended to upgrade to this template as the last update for this template was made over <u>**two**</u> years ago and lacks features compared to this one.
 3. The latest version of [Ren'Py 7](https://renpy.org/latest-7.html) or [Ren'Py 8](https://renpy.org/latest-8.html).

## Installation Steps

1. Download the latest version of Ren'Py the mod template supports and download the EXE, DMG, or TAR.BZ2 file.

> If you are on Ren'Py 7, download `DDLCModTemplate-X.X.X.zip`. If you are on Ren'Py 8, download `DDLCModTemplate-X.X.X-Py3.zip`.
4. Go to the `renpy-X.X.X-sdk` folder, then make a new folder with the name of your mod. For this example, I named it *A New DDLC Mod*.
